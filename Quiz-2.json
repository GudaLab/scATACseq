      {
        "answer": "Chromatin signal is averaged for all cells in a sample, limiting insights into low-abundance phenotypes or rare populations of cells.",
        "correct": true,
        "feedback": "Yes. scATAC-Seq enables researchers to interrogate the chromatin landscape of hundreds to thousands of individual cells at the single-cell level."
      },
      {
        "answer": "Low cell viability causes unreliable cell recovery.",
        "correct": false,
        "feedback": "Not quite. Bulk ATACseq represents abundance of chromatin, therefore, is not a caveat."
      },
      {
        "answer": "Analyze chromatin accessibility in thousands of individual cells per sample.",
        "correct": false,
        "feedback": "Not quite. bulk ATACseq analyses the chromatin signal in aggregates."
      },
      {
        "answer": "As compared to single-cell, bulk ATAC-Seq technology requires much more starting material..",
        "correct": false,
        "feedback": "Not quite. The ATAC-Seq protocol requires only about 50,000 cells as starting material,."
